<h1>It's time to Emojify</h1>
Emojify_Me is one of the funniest app I built, It uses the Mobile Vision library
to get the user's face impression and replace it by an emoji!.
First the User open the Camera from the app, then capture an image and after that the app gets the
image and process it with library to get the appropriate impressions
of the user and finally replace the User's face by an emoji according to the User's impression.
